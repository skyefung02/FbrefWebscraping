For example, if a player started the game in DM, but moved to RM, then the position entry would be DM, RM.). We then further refined the entries by combining certain groups (so observations with a 1 in either LW or RW were marked as having a 1 in Wingers).

In other words, if we know a player is going to have a penalty attempt in a game, the probability of them scoring a goal is quite high. However, this isn't necessarily the most relevant information. We also saw that Penalty Success Rate (calculated as the proportion of Successful Penalties over Penalties Attempted) didn't necessarily provide any additional information. However, we did also do some feature engineering, which allowed us to mark certain Player ID's as 'Designated Penalty Takers'. We then saw that the proportion of goalscoring observations was much higher for the designated penalty takers, compared to the non-designated penalty takers. Based on this, we will include the 'Penalties Attempted' and 'Designated Penalty Taker' features. The 'Penalties Scored' feature will be removed for now. \n",
