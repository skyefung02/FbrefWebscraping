    "* Result - We transformed this feature by splitting it into two features. 'Outcome' (whether or not the game being played in ended up in a Win, Loss or Draw) and 'Score' (the final score of the game). We then further transformed the 'Score' feature into 'Team Goals', by looking at the number of goals scored by the team in that game. We ended up seeing that the number of goals conceded in a game didn't really matter. Therefore, we will get rid of the 'Score' feature, and only keep 'Outcome' and 'Team Goals'. "

For example, if a player started the game in DM, but moved to RM, then the position entry would be DM, RM.).
